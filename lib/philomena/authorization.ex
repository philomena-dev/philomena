  The single authorization entry point for context functions.

  Context functions call `authorize/3` at the start of a write
  (or before returning a loaded record on a read).

  This is a thin wrapper over Canada: the permission rules themselves remain the
  single source of truth in `Philomena.Users.Ability` (`lib/philomena/users/ability.ex`).

  The actor is permitted to be `nil` (an anonymous visitor).

  Authorizes `actor` to perform `action` on `subject`.

  Returns `:ok` when Canada permits the action, otherwise
  `{:error, :unauthorized}`.

  `actor` may be `nil` for an anonymous visitor. It may also be a
  `Philomena.Attribution.Actor`: permissions are decided by its `user` alone -
  the IP and fingerprint attribute the action but grant nothing - so contexts
  that take an attribution can pass it here unchanged.

  ## Examples

      iex> authorize(user, :hide, image)
      :ok

      iex> authorize(nil, :hide, image)
      {:error, :unauthorized}

      iex> authorize(%Actor{user: moderator, ip: ip}, :revert, TagChange)
      :ok

  Verifies that `actor` may perform a write.

  Decides, in order:

    * `{:error, :ban}` when the actor carries an active ban;
    * `{:error, :unauthorized}` when the actor has no fingerprint;
    * `:ok` otherwise.

  The fingerprint requirement applies regardless of whether a user is signed in.

  ## Deliberate exceptions

  These personal preference actions intentionally permit banned users:

  - Switching the current filter
  - Clearing recent filters
  - Changing the active spoiler type
  - Clearing notifications
  - Updating user settings
  - Watching/unwatching tags
  - Creating/deleting subscriptions

  The actions still perform their own authentication and resource
  authorization checks.
