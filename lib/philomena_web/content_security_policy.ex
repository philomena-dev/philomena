defmodule PhilomenaWeb.ContentSecurityPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  Builds and serializes the application's Content Security Policy (CSP).

  Policies are represented as maps whose keys are directive names (for example,
  `:script_src`) and whose values are lists of CSP source expressions. The
  policy produced by `conn_policy/2` starts with the application's restrictive
  baseline and then incorporates request-specific and environment-specific
  sources:

    * same-origin sources are allowed for document, script, connection, form,
      manifest, image, and media requests;
    * objects and frame ancestors are denied, while `frame-src` is denied until
      a source is explicitly added;
    * `:cdn_host` and `:camo_host` configuration values are added as HTTPS image
      and media origins; and
    * Vite development origins are added when Vite hot-module reloading is
      enabled.

  Use `merge_policy/2` to append source expressions to an existing policy, and
  `serialize/1` to turn the policy into the value of a
  `content-security-policy` response header.

  Builds the CSP policy applicable to a `m:Plug.Conn`.

  The returned policy begins with the module's baseline policy, adds the
  configured CDN and Camo hosts to `img-src` and `media-src`, and adds the Vite
  development and websocket origins when Vite hot-module reloading is enabled.

  `additions` contains request-specific directive sources and is merged last,
  so callers can extend the baseline for a particular response. It defaults to
  an empty policy.

  Hosts configured through `:cdn_host` and `:camo_host` are interpreted as host
  names and serialized as HTTPS origins. `conn` is used to derive the Vite
  origins, so it should contain the request host when hot reloading is in use.

  ## Examples

      iex> conn = Plug.Test.conn(:get, "/")
      iex> policy = PhilomenaWeb.ContentSecurityPolicy.conn_policy(conn)
      iex> policy.default_src
      ["'self'"]

  Appends source expressions from `additions` to a CSP `policy`.

  Entries with the same directive are concatenated in their existing order;
  directives present only in `additions` are added to the map. This function
  can be used repeatedly while a request accumulates permissions.

  Unknown directive keys are preserved in the returned map, although
  `serialize/1` emits only the directives supported by this module.

  Serializes a policy map as a `Content-Security-Policy` header value.

  directives supported by this module are emitted, even when `policy` contains
  additional keys.
