      Getting on the DNP list?
    </h3>
    <p>
      We offer the DNP list in order to give artists the last say on their art, but we
      won't deny that we are sad whenever we see good art and artists disappear.
      Because we know that many who seek a DNP do so on their first contact with the site,
      we'd be very grateful if you as the artist would like to give the site a shot first.
      Why not upload some of your own art? The community might appreciate it more than you think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you wish to submit a DNP Request?
      <button class="button button--separate-left js-dnp-yes" data-click-disable=".js-dnp-yes" data-click-show=".js-dnp-common-options">
        Yes

    <h3>
      Options
    </h3>
    <p>
      We are aware of several common reasons for why artists seek a DNP.
      They include things such as unwanted edits or a wish to disassociate
      their name from their artwork. Many of these concerns can be addressed
      without removing art.

    <p>
      We have created several options for you below:
