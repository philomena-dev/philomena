    p Once the link has been verified you can remove the text; the text simply allows the team to directly check with your website rather than messaging you and waiting for a reply.

  - rejected?(@artist_link) ->
    p This link has been rejected by a member of the administration team; this is probably because you were not reachable in a timely manner (~1 week) to verify the link.
