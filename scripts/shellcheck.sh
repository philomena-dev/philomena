# This script runs shellcheck on all shell scripts in the repository.
# It exists because shellcheck doesn't attempt to automatically discover
# shell scripts and requires specifying the files paths explicitly.
#
# This is somewhat understandable, because not all shell scripts use
# obvious file extensions like `.sh`. So, we discover such files by
# checking if they have one of the expected shebang lines at the beginning.
