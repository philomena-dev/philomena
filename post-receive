# Include a task to restart your running appserver instances here.
#
# In general, you should have many app instances configured on different
# ports using the PORT environment variable, so as to allow you to roll
# releases and deploy new code with no visible downtime.
#
# You can use a reverse proxy like haproxy or nginx to load balance between
# different server instances automatically.
