# Advertising

This is the default advertisement policy page of Philomena! Edit this with your site's advertising prices, requirements and contact details. A good advertisement page mentions what kind of advertisements are accepted (e.g. community ads only), NSFW advertisement policy, free advertisement policy (e.g. if you'd like to offer free short-term ads to independent artists), paid advertisement policy (pricing per month, terms, required advance notice, etc), technical requirements of the advertisement banner image (see below), and anything else you might want a potential advertiser to know. Don't forget to mention how a potential advertiser might contact you about advertisement inquiries.

Philomena is designed to accept advertisements with the following parameters:

**File size:** no larger than 500 kilobytes (500000 bytes)
**Format:** PNG, GIF or JPG/JPEG
**Max resolution:** 729x91 pixels
