# About Philomena

Philomena is state of the art software for powering image boorus (image sharing/commenting/voting sites). At the forefront of its goals is to be the easiest-to-use and most intuitive imageboard software around. It is also designed to be easy to scale on a technical level, requiring less system resources than other booru software, saving you the hassle of getting big servers with serious hardware.

It was initially written for [Derpibooru](https://derpibooru.org), the largest image sharing site aimed at the fans of the My Little Pony cartoon, from scratch with a view to making a really good web application for sharing images. It has since outgrown Derpibooru, and now powers many other image sharing sites, such as [Furbooru](https://furbooru.org).

We hope you enjoy using this software! Please make sure to share any suggestions and report any issues you may find with it [in the issues section of our GitHub repository](https://github.com/philomena-dev/philomena/issues).
