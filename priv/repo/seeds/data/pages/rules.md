# The Rules

0. Be nice to each other. **The most important rule.**
   - Do not post content whose sole purpose is to cause anger or controversy
   - Do not post hate speech
   - Do not harass others or try to incite violence against them
   - Do not discriminate based on personal characteristics (e.g. gender, race, religion, etc)
   - Criticism is welcome and encouraged, but only when it's polite
   - This rule applies to all images
1. Respect the authors of the content
   - Do not upload without permission from the author
   - Do not upload private content (e.g. paid-for exclusive content)
   - Do not upload copyrighted content (e.g. snippets from movies or TV shows)
   - Respect the Do-Not-Post list
   - Do not upload watermarked images with the watermark removed, unless done so publicly by the author
2. Tag images appropriately
   - Pick the rating tag appropriately
   - Try to use as many tags as you can
   - Use tags appropriate to the image
3. Do not post content unrelated to this website
   - Do not post content unrelated to the theme of this website
   - Content isn't necessarily considered "related" just because it has themed content in it, for example, putting an image over a meme template would not automatically qualify your image as "related"
4. Use filters to hide content you don't like
   - Instead of posting comments about the content you dislike, use filters to hide it
   - If you believe something violates the site rules, report it instead of commenting about it
   - Filter content which you cannot view in your current jurisdiction
5. Do not post content illegal in this website's jurisdiction
   - Do not upload real-life underage pornography or art which attempts to emulate it
   - Do not upload real-life bestiality or art which attempts to emulate it
   - Do not upload prohibited hate symbols, such as the swastika
6. Do not abuse site functionality
   - Do not use multiple accounts to evade punishments or to pretend to be two different people in the same discussion
   - Do not spam
   - Do not post off-topic comments or derail discussion
   - Do not indiscriminately downvote or upvote images based on any characteristic (e.g. creator, tags, uploader, and so on)
   - Do not impersonate staff members
7. Spoiler content which cannot be filtered
   - Respect the sexual rating of the place you're posting in, reserve NSFW posts for forum topics clearly marked as NSFW
   - Use the `||spoiler syntax||` to spoiler any content which is not rated "safe", and which built-in site functionality cannot automatically filter.
   - Avatars must be rated "safe" and not include any animations that might induce seizures
8. Respect privacy
   - Do not reveal any private information which the person might not be comfortable sharing publicly without the permission of said person
   - If you are aware of an artist or a user using multiple aliases to separate their work, do not reveal this information publicly without their consent
9. Advertise commissions in good faith - we are not responsible for any misuse of commissions listing
   - All commissions must contain only the artwork created by the person advertising the commission
   - You may not advertise a commission on behalf of another person
   - Site staff are not responsible for any commission arrangements or outcomes based on commission advertisements

Rules are not exhaustive, the site staff have the final say.
