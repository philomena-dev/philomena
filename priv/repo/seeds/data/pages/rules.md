# The Rules

0. Be nice to each other. **The most important rule.**
   - Do not post content whose sole purpose is to cause anger or controversy
   - Do not post hate speech
   - Do not harass others or try to incite violence against them
   - Do not discriminate based on physical characteristics (e.g. gender, race, etc) or religious beliefs
   - Criticism is welcome and encouraged, but only when it's polite
   - This rule applies to all content posted on site (images, comments, and everything else)
1. Respect the authors of the content
   - Do not upload without permission from the author

   - Try to use as many tags as you can
   - Use tags appropriate to the image
3. Do not post content unrelated to this website
   - Do not post content unrelated to the theme of this website
   - Images are not considered "related" by the presence of themed content; images must meet a threshold of artistic effort to be uploaded
4. Use filters to hide content you don't wish to see
   - Do not post comments expressing dislike for general themes; use filters to hide images with these themes
   - If you believe something violates the site rules, report it instead of commenting about it
   - Filter content which you cannot view in your current jurisdiction

   - Do not post barely-related single-word comments on images
   - Do not post unsolicited advertisement
   - Do not post off-topic comments or derail discussion
   - Vote on images based on their artistic merit; do not indiscriminately vote based on a filterable characteristic of the image
   - Do not impersonate staff members
7. Spoiler content which cannot be filtered
   - Respect the sexual rating of where you post; reserve NSFW posts for forum topics clearly marked as NSFW
   - Use the `||spoiler syntax||` to spoiler above-rating text, which built-in site functionality cannot automatically filter
   - Avatars must not contain sexual content or flickering animations which may induce seizures
8. Respect privacy
   - Do not reveal any personal information about artists or other users without consent
   - If you are aware of an artist or a user using multiple aliases to separate their work, do not reveal this information publicly without their consent
9. Advertise commissions in good faith
   - All commissions must contain only the artwork created by the person advertising the commission
   - You may not advertise a commission on behalf of another person
   - Site staff are not responsible for any commission arrangements or outcomes based on commission advertisements

Rules are not exhaustive, the site staff have the final say.
