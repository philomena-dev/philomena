# Stop batching servers for the duration of the test run. They periodically wake
# and flush whatever updates have been cast to them. An empty flush is free, but
# as soon as a controller test runs then the servers will receive data and issue
# real writes - from a process that owns no sandbox connection, so with the
# sandbox in :manual mode it raises DBConnection.OwnershipError. Terminating the
# child avoids the periodic noise. GenServer.cast to the now-dead name still
# returns :ok silently, so casts during tests are harmlessly dropped.

# Create every searchable index once, with the current mappings. Tests get

# deletes documents - dropping and recreating an index costs ~95 ms and used to
# run once per test.
